## 🎯 Objective

The main objective of Edu Tutor is to create a personalized learning experience that adapts to individual student needs and learning styles. By offering diverse multimedia resources such as videos, quizzes, and simulations, the application aims to engage students effectively and enhance their understanding of the material. Real-time feedback on assessments will help students identify their strengths and areas for improvement, while gamified elements will motivate them and make learning enjoyable. Edu Tutor also fosters community support through discussion forums and group projects, encouraging collaboration among students. The app is designed to be accessible for all users, including those with disabilities, ensuring an inclusive learning environment. With a user-friendly interface and responsive design, Edu Tutor allows for seamless navigation and accessibility across various devices. By leveraging Groq's capabilities to analyze data, the application continuously improves its educational content and algorithms. Ultimately, Edu Tutor empowers learners with the tools and resources they need to achieve their academic goals and build confidence in their abilities.

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
`Your team name here`

### Team Members:  
- Name 1 PENDYALA HEMANTH KUMAR
- Name 2 BATTULA CHARAN KUMAR

### Your Approach:  
- I built the project using React and Vite for the frontend, offering a fast and interactive UI. The Node.js and Express.js backend handles user requests and integrates seamlessly with the database. MongoDB is used for flexible, scalable data storage.

A key feature of the project is the integration with the GROQ AI API, which processes images, audio, and text inputs from users. The AI provides step-by-step answers, helping students understand problems in a detailed, interactive way.

Additionally, I included a section with math games to make learning enjoyable and engaging. These games allow students to practice math concepts while having fun, reinforcing learning through interactive challenges.

The combination of these technologies provides a smooth, engaging, and educational experience that caters to different learning styles.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Core Technologies Used:
- Frontend: React+vite,tailwind css,
- Backend: Node.js Express.js
- Database: MONGO DB
- APIs: GROQ AI API

### Sponsor Technologies Used (if any):
- [ ] **Groq:**  I integrated Groq AI to enhance the learning experience by providing step-by-step solutions to students. The API takes inputs in the form of images, audio, and text from users. When a student uploads an image of a math problem, records an audio query, or types in a question, Groq processes these inputs and generates a detailed, easy-to-understand response.
